///
/// - **Paused**: Subscription is temporarily suspended, no charges are processed.
///   - Can transition to: `Active`, `Cancelled`
///
/// - **Cancelled**: Subscription is permanently terminated, no further changes allowed.
///   - No outgoing transitions (terminal state)
///
/// - **InsufficientBalance**: Subscription failed due to insufficient funds.
///   - This status is automatically set when a charge attempt fails due to insufficient
///     prepaid balance.
///   - Can transition to: `Active` (after deposit + resume), `Cancelled`
///   - The subscription cannot be charged while in this status.
///
/// # When InsufficientBalance Occurs
///
/// A subscription transitions to `InsufficientBalance` when:
/// 1. A [`crate::SubscriptionVault::charge_subscription`] call finds `prepaid_balance < amount`
/// 2. A [`crate::SubscriptionVault::charge_usage`] call drains the balance to zero
///
/// # Recovery from InsufficientBalance
///
/// To recover from `InsufficientBalance`:
/// 1. Subscriber calls [`crate::SubscriptionVault::deposit_funds`] to add funds
/// 2. Subscriber calls [`crate::SubscriptionVault::resume_subscription`] to transition back to `Active`
/// 3. Subsequent charges will succeed if sufficient balance exists

/// [`Error::InvalidStatusTransition`].
